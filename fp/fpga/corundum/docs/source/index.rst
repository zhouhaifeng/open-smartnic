Introduction
============

Corundum is an open-source, high-performance :term:`FPGA`-based :term:`NIC` and platform for in-network compute.  Features include a high performance datapath, 10G/25G/100G Ethernet, PCI express gen 3, a custom, high performance, tightly-integrated :term:`PCIe` :term:`DMA` engine, many (1000+) transmit, receive, completion, and event queues, scatter/gather DMA, :term:`MSI`, multiple interfaces, multiple ports per interface, per-port transmit scheduling including high precision TDMA, flow hashing, :term:`RSS`, checksum offloading, and native IEEE 1588 :term:`PTP` timestamping.  A Linux driver is included that integrates with the Linux networking stack.  Development and debugging is facilitated by an extensive simulation framework that covers the entire system from a simulation model of the driver and PCI express interface on one side to the Ethernet interfaces on the other side.

Corundum has several unique architectural features.  First, transmit, receive, completion, and event queue states are stored efficiently in block RAM or ultra RAM, enabling support for thousands of individually-controllable queues.  These queues are associated with interfaces, and each interface can have multiple ports, each with its own independent scheduler.  This enables extremely fine-grained control over packet transmission.  Coupled with PTP time synchronization, this enables high precision TDMA.

Corundum also provides an application section for implementing custom logic.  The application section has a dedicated PCIe BAR for control and a number of interfaces that provide access to the core datapath and DMA infrastructure.

The latest source code is available from the `Corundum GitHub repository <https://github.com/corundum/corundum>`_.
