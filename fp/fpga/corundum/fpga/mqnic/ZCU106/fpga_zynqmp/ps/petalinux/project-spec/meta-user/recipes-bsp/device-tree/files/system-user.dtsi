/* WORKAROUND:
 * Letting the Linux driver for USER MGT SI570 (U56) chip program the output
 * frequency causes the peer of mqnic's PHY to loose its link.
 * Reason: The USER MGT SI570 (U56) chip is used as the source for the 156.25 MHz
 * MGT ref clock. And the factory default is 156.25 HHz. However the frequency
 * hard-coded into the PetaLinux device tree snippet for the ZCU106 board
 * (file: zcu106-reva.dtsi) is 148.5 MHz.
 *
 * However even when overwriting the "clock-frequency" property to 156.25 MHz and
 * letting the Linux driver reprogram/reconfigure the USER MGT SI570 (U56) chip
 * with this desired frequency the mqnic's PHY RX direction still breaks (block
 * lock lost); the peer however still keeps saying "link up".
 *
 * Thus, for now, we make Linux NOT load the driver for the USER MGT SI570 (U56)
 * chip.
 * In the future the mqnic PHY may get a control interface, in order for the
 * software to reprogram the USER MGT SI570 (U56) chip and then be able to
 * trigger a PHY reset.
