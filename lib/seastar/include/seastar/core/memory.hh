/// \defgroup memory-module Memory management
///
/// Functions and classes for managing memory.
///
/// Memory management in seastar consists of the following:
///
///   - Low-level memory management in the \ref memory namespace.
///   - Various smart pointers: \ref shared_ptr, \ref lw_shared_ptr,
///     and \ref foreign_ptr.
///   - zero-copy support: \ref temporary_buffer and \ref deleter.

/// Low-level memory management support
///
/// The \c memory namespace provides functions and classes for interfacing
/// with the seastar memory allocator.
///
/// The seastar memory allocator splits system memory into a pool per
/// logical core (lcore).  Memory allocated one an lcore should be freed
/// on the same lcore; failing to do so carries a severe performance
/// penalty.  It is possible to share memory with another core, but this
/// should be limited to avoid cache coherency traffic.
/// You can obtain the memory layout of the current shard with
/// \ref get_memory_layout().
///
/// ## Critical allocation scopes
///
/// Seastar supports marking scopes as critical allocation scopes for the purpose
/// of special treatment from various memory related utilities.
/// See \ref scoped_critical_alloc_section.
///
/// ## Diagnostics and debugging features
///
/// ### Allocation failure injector
///
/// Allows injecting allocation failures for testing resiliency against
/// allocation failures, or exceptions in general. See:
/// * \ref alloc_failure_injector
/// * \ref with_allocation_failures()
///
/// ### Large allocation warning
///
/// Large allocations put great pressure on the allocator which might be unable
/// to serve them even if there is enough memory available, due to memory
/// fragmentation. This is especially relevant for long-running applications,
/// the kind of applications that are typically built with seastar. This feature
/// allows finding these large by logging a warning on large allocations, with
/// the stacktrace of the. See:
/// * \ref set_large_allocation_warning_threshold()
/// * \ref get_large_allocation_warning_threshold()
/// * \ref scoped_large_allocation_warning_threshold
/// * \ref scoped_large_allocation_warning_disable
///
/// ### Heap profiling
///
/// Heap profiling allows finding out how memory is used by your application, by
/// recording the stacktrace of all allocations. See:
/// * \ref set_heap_profiling_enabled()
/// * \ref scoped_heap_profiling
///
/// ### Abort on allocation failure
///
/// Often, the best way to debug an allocation failure is a coredump. This
/// feature allows dumping core on allocation failures, containing the stack of
/// the failed allocation, by means of aborting. To enable set the
/// `abort_on_seastar_bad_alloc` configuration option or the respective command
/// line flag.
///
/// ### Dump diagnostics report
///
/// Dump a diagnostic report of the state of the seastar allocator upon allocation
/// failure. The report is dumped with the `seastar_memory` logger, with debug
/// level.
/// You can configure a report to be dumped with error level on certain allocation
/// kinds, see:
/// * set_dump_memory_diagnostics_on_alloc_failure_kind()
/// * set_additional_diagnostics_producer()
/// * generate_memory_diagnostics_report()
///
/// The diagnostics report dump can be configured with the command
/// line/configuration file via the \p dump-memory-diagnostics-on-alloc-failure-kind
/// command-line flag/configuration item.
