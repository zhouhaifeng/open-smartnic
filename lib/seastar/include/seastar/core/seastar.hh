/// within seastar and able to drive network cards directly.
/// The native stack supports zero-copy on both transmit
/// and receive, and is implemented using seastar's high
/// performance, lockless sharded design.  The network stack
/// can be selected with the \c \--network-stack command-line
/// parameter.
